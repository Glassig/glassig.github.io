# My personal website
There is no real use for this, other than I just want to have a cute personal website. 

**Designed by**: me.

**Coded by**: me.

## Dependencies
To view it, nothing. But for development, run `npm i` for sass and concurrently, then install python for a simple http server.

## Known issues
* Landscape mode on mobiles is not the prettiest. The text is readable and it can be viewed, but the doggos ends are visible and the text overlaps the long doggo. I don't have the energy to fix it.
* The "long doggo" on mobile could be longer, just in case of a wide screen. Between 750-645px, you can see the end. Just a slightly longer doggo would fix it. Maybe create a medium doggo?
