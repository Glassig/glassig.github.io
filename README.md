# My personal website

There is no real use for this, other than I just want to have a cute personal website.

**Designed by**: me.

**Coded by**: me.

**Doggo by**: me.

## Development

You can view the page by opening index.html in the browser. You can also run `npm i` to get some tools, then use `npm start` for a little nodemon webserver that updates on filechanges.

## Known issues

- Landscape mode on mobiles is not the prettiest. The text is readable and it can be viewed, but the doggos ends are visible and the text overlaps the long doggo. I don't have the energy to fix it.
- The "long doggo" on mobile could be longer, just in case of a wide screen. Between 750-645px, you can see the end. Just a slightly longer doggo would fix it. Maybe create a medium doggo?
- Doggos might be childish. Should I replace with color blocks?
