# My personal website
It's like my resum√© in web-format. Written using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MetalsmithJS and markdown. 
## Static v Dynamic
So, for hosting's sake, this is a static version. Which means that I edit my dynamic version, starts a hosting for it, uses a command to download it and then modifies whatever broke. If you want to see the dynamic version, check out [it's repo](https://github.com/Glassig/website).
## The command
(Because I need help remembering it):

wget -mpck --user-agent="" -e robots=off --wait 1 -E WEBSITE_ADDRESS

WEBSITE_ADDRESS can be "localhost:3000"
