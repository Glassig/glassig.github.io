<p>
    Story time! At my first web developer job, I had an amazing tech lead. I had no idea what I was doing, but he was very patient and helped me learn. This did not mean he was going easy on you; his code reviews were <i>extremly</i> difficult to get through. He looked at every little detail, which was good because it allowed you to learn and improve. But when he commented "you misspelled something in the commit message", it could be quite frustrating. "That commit is too big, break it up into two". "You have a double digit number of commits in this PR, get it down to single digit".
</p>
<p>
    When I have told other people about these code reviews, they think of it as nightmarish and unecessarily nitpicky. However, I feel two things about it; master is holy so keep it pristine, and git is a tool that you should use.
</p>
<h5>All praise the holy master</h5>

    The job was a startup. When I entered it, we were 4 people; me, the tech lead, the CTO and the CEO. Most people working at a startup will agree that moving fast is important, and if you are fewer people you have to multitask. There are three features that you are working on at the same time, and if suddenly a pesky bug appears you will have to stop everything and fix it. And one of the most important tools for any production is the rollback; oh shiet, a bug, rollback rollback rollback. But, where did that bug appear? The latest feature had several commits, and some looks like the person was testing different things and commenting away some functions. In a few of the commits the program doesn't even compile. Which was the last stable commit? Don't pollute master with a bunch of shit. That is just dirtying it.
